Previously, placing ToastProvider inside a ScrollView would make toasts appear inside the scroll content (~40% from the top instead of at the top) and scroll with the page.

In dark mode this rendered noticeably darker than the muted-foreground text. Now flips between #71717a (light) and #a1a1aa (dark). placeholderTextColor is a native RN prop — NativeWind doesn't process it, so the previous hsl(var(--muted-foreground)) attempt also did not work.", link: "/docs/input" },
